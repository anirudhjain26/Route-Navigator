# Route Navigator - a Graph-Based Routing Service

- Developed a graph-based routing service in Java, leveraging graph data structures and Dijkstra's algorithm for efficient U.S. city-to-city highway navigation.
- Implemented data parsing logic for graph initialization from raw data files, and built a user-friendly interface for city specification by name or coordinates.
- Optimized route calculations with an algorithm to identify nearest vertices in the graph, and visualized routes on a USA map, improving user experience and system efficiency.
